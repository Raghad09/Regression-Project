##  Used Car Prices - Problem


Recently, many people are turnout toward buying a used car over a new car in order to save money.  with the increased global demand in used car sales, many companies have launched online marketplaces which serve as a mediator for selling and buying cars.

The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. but for used cars, it can be stressful for sellers to value their car because the price depends on many factors.  It is important to know the actual market value while both buying and selling. There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features.

  

## Predicting Used Car Prices with Linear Regression Model

  

During the first few weeks of SDAIA Data Science Bootcamp, I've obtained many skills in programming, statistics, and data analytics. I am planning to apply data science methodologies to the available data sources in order to design a solution for the client (MTA Maintenance Department) and help them achieve their main goal which is rescheduling maintenance work to minimize riders delays.

  

I intend to work with SQL Database via Python SQLalchemy, EDA in Pandas, and Python visualization libraries and other tools to answer some questions and to come up with interesting insights such as:

  

- Understand the impact of elevator outages within the NYC subway system

- Study the effect of rainy days on train ridership in order to schedule cleaning work.

- Finding the overall busiest stations.

  

### Data Sources

  

In this project, We intend to scrape two website and use additional dataset for more comprehensive used car data.

  

-  [Autotrader](https://www.autotrader.com/) : An online marketplace for car buyers and sellers. It aggregates new, used, and certified second-hand cars from dealers and private sellers.

-  [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/): Website for shopping and selling used cars. there is a list of features for each car.

-  [Craigslist Cars-trucks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) : a dataset from Craigslist. it contains all relevant information on used car sales including price, condition, manufacturer, and other 23 columns. the dataset is scraped every few months has over 426k rows.
