## Predicting Used Car Price using Linear Regression
Many people are turnout towards buying used cars to save money, and it can be stressful for sellers to value their car because the price depends on many factors. In this project, we built a prediction system to effectively determine the price of the used car based on its features. We trained a linear regression model to predict the used car price based on data scraped from different car-selling websites. Different experiments have been applied in order to optimize prediction.
